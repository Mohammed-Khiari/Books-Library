# Books-Library
**The books Library project** is a project that could:
* Add Books cards with some book's info such as (Title, Author, Pages, Read or not and for sure remove button).
* I used js LocalStorage to render myLibrary when the page is refreshed. <br/>
**In this App I learned:**
* How to add window EventListeners for Open, Close, and click outside the form.
* How to prepare the container and display using js function.
* How to add very good animations for a better UI experience.
* and more css soft skills.
